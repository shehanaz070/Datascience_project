## 🧠 Project Overview

We combined two real-world datasets:

1. **Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset**
   - Contains daily sentiment labels: Greed, Fear, Extreme Greed, etc.

2. **Hyperliquid Historical Trader Data**
   - Includes execution price, side, size, leverage, closed PnL, and more.

We merged the two on the date and explored:

- How trader profitability changes under different sentiment conditions.
- Whether high profit trades align more with "Greed" or "Fear".
- Insightful visualization of profit trends across sentiments.

## 📈 Key Insight

📌 Traders tend to show higher **average profits during Greed and Extreme Greed**.  
📉 Losses increase during Fear and Extreme Fear.

This suggests that market sentiment can be a meaningful signal for adjusting trading strategy and risk.
